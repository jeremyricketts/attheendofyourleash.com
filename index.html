<h2 class="desc">Welcome!</h2>
<p class="desc">Have you tried training on your own only to realize just how frustrating it can be?  Have you tried other trainers only to find their methods to be ineffective?  When you are at the end of your rope with your dog's behavior, and are ready to end the canine chaos in your home, we are ready to help!  </p>
</div><!-- /desc  -->

<h3 class="large">Why Training is Important</h3>

<p>Your dog is learning 24 hours a day with, or without, your guidance. Being proactive in your dogs training is a perfect opportunity for you to teach your dog necessary, and useful behaviors to become a wonderful companion, and trusted member of the family.</p>

<p>Training opens up communication between you and your dog, enhancing your relationship and understanding. Teaching your dog rules, boundaries, and limitations is not only for their own safety, but for the safety of others as well. Our training program will help your dog become a courteous asset to the neighborhood instead of a troublesome nuisance. Learning methods of prevention is the best foundation for solving many behavior problems, and teaches you how to appropriately deal with everyday canine challenges. Training nurtures confidence and predictability, as well as creating a calm, balanced, and well-mannered family companion.</p>

<p>Dogs often find trouble in, and around your home when they become bored, and are not fulfilled. Training is excellent mental stimulation for your dog; and as we all know, a tired dog is a good dog! Your dog is likely to be a loyal member of your family for more than 10 years; don’t you owe it to yourself to have a well-trained family companion? Training with At the End of Your Leash&trade; is one of the most invaluable gifts you can give your dog, and your family.</p>

<h3 class="large">Our Methods and Philosophy</h3>

<p>Our goal is to treat your dog and family as a whole unit in order to bring a harmonious way of living to your home. We use methods of training developed by Jenifer as she draws from only the best resources available, as well as her years of hands-on experience. We are also trained in, and enjoy teaching pet owners, the same training techniques used by “Dog Whisperer” Cesar Millan, as taught to Jenifer by Linn Boyke. You will learn the Fulfillment Formula (Exercise, Discipline, Affection), as well as how to understand the Animal, Species, Breed, and Personality in your dog. You will be taught how to balance your canine companion through a thorough understanding of dog behavior and psychology, as well as how to set rules, boundaries, and limitations that all of you can live with.</p>

<p>We are also trained in techniques that use positive motivation and reinforcement based on operant and classical conditioning methods to modify and improve the behavior of your dog. We believe in using a combination of true pack leadership, food treats, praise, a favorite toy, and play to help motivate your companion to want to work with you. As professional trainers who have worked for many years with all breeds, sizes, and temperaments of dogs, we understand that using just one training technique may not work for your dog. Our skilled trainers are prepared to draw from all styles and forms of training, and are ready to use the best tools and methods for your dog.</p>

<p>Our natural, effective methods create an enjoyable training experience for both you and your dog. These methods, and variations work for all breeds and types of dogs, allowing for clear communication, reduced training time, better retention, and a greatly enhanced relationship between you and your now well-mannered dog.</p>

<h3 class="large">A Note On Aggression</h3>

<p class="block">In recent years, aggressive behavior in pet dogs has become front-page news. The details of mauling deaths of adults and sudden attacks on children send chills down the backs of dog lovers everywhere. Certain breeds have been singled out as dangerously aggressive; the truth is all breeds, large and small, can and will become dangerously aggressive if unbalanced. The reality behind all of this is that acts of aggression are, in most cases, preventable. By understanding how to address a dog's state of mind, dog owners can become aware of early signs of aggression in their dogs, and correct the imbalances before they lead to tragedy.</p>

<p class="block">We are experienced at working patiently with aggression in all breeds. Our goal is to build trust, respect, and a good working relationship in order to balance the state of mind, and positively modify the unwanted behavior.</p>

<p class="block">To ensure successful training, as well as a happy, confident and well-balanced companion, you and your family are involved with the training process from start to finish! So, if you think you have tried everything to train your dog, and are still at the end of your leash give us a call before you give up on your loyal companion; we have your behavior solutions.</p>
