<div id="testi_1" class="moo_baby_moo">
<p class="block">It's a well-known fact that people get pets as therapy and for something to love. Gunnie Girl entered my life when my teenage daughter begged to have her. Due to a personal tragedy in our life, I knew Gunnie girl would serve an important role in my daughters' life, so Gunnie came to us as a small, furry, puppy. Our lives progressed and blossomed. Time went on and my teenage daughter grew into a young woman, moved out and went to college to live on her own. Gunnie, the once small, furry ball turned into a 100 lb beautiful German Shepherd. I decided she needed a new home and tried to place her. She interviewed with many families. Unfortunately, Gunnie Girl was a very insecure, overly cautious, (dare I say, not very friendly) gal. One day "a thought hit me like a bolt of lightening" I wanted Gunnie Girl; her place was with me. Given Gunnie's lack of socialization I recognized I needed professional help with her if I was to keep her. That is when Jennifer Freilich entered out life.<br /><br />From Jennifer's first visit with Gunnie she diagnosed Gunnie with the need for more socialization. She explained that basic obedience training would give Gunnie more confidence. She also correctly interpreted Gunnie's anxiety in situations due to her insecurity. Jennifer assured me Gunnie would respond very well to training, as she wants to follow, not lead. Gunnie is at her best when she is working.<br /><br />Over the next several months the change in Gunnie was remarkable. She became self-assured and willingly anticipated her commands. Once her "working" leash was on, she felt safe and fell in line with proper behavior. It dramatically reduced her insecurity and fears. It made changes in me also. Gunnie and I bonded over this period of training. I came to trust Gunnie's responses. I came to realize the dog is rarely ever the problem; they only need training.<br /><br />Jennifer's energy and knowledge is remarkable. Her professional demeanor and no nonsense approach to both dog and trainer kept Gunnie and me accountable for what we were all trying to achieve. For Gunnie Girl and me, our experience with Jennifer was a very positive and successful one.<br /><br />
Best Wishes,<br />

<div id="testi_2" class="moo_baby_moo">
<p class="block">I adopted a beautiful Golden Retriever mix from a rescue shelter around two years ago.  It was obvious this dog had been mistreated and had been seriously abused/beaten.  He was a handful when I got him, but I could tell he liked me.  The shelter told me I was the only one he warmed up to and the only one he cuddled up to.  He even offered me his belly to rub.  The adoption agent said she'd taken him on her various showings and said he didn't even let her get that close to him, let alone others.  (I figured they told everyone that so the dogs would get adopted, but later I realized she was telling me the truth.)<br /><br />Copperfield was aggressive towards everyone but me and I found on walks he was seriously aggressive towards other dogs.  I contacted Jen about a week after I brought him home.  I told her I'd adopted Satin's dog! Now, just so you know, I'm no stranger to dog training.  I've won the top dog trainer in the past when I've trained my previous dogs, but nothing I tried could get my new dog, Copperfield to settle down or behave decently.<br /><br />Jen came immediately and started me on my first week of lessons.  I saw improvements right away.  We continued working on him and I followed her lessons.  I now have one of the best-behaved dogs in Southern California.  Everyone says what a delightful dog he is, and I don't worry about him around the cat, or a new kitten, or around houseguests like I used to.  He used to take a nip at anyone that entered the house...including my roommate!<br /><br />

<p class="block">I have known Jenifer Freilich for several years now. I was first introduced to her as a specialized dog obedience trainer. She helped me work with my dysfunctional pack of dogs, and even attended an animal control hearing to assist in conflict resolution. She was of great support for our family, and did more than we ever expected her to. Jen is always willing to take on new behavioral issues, and I don't think any situation would surprise her. She genuinely loves what she does, and is always ready to tackle new challenges. I am always eager to refer Jen to others who are at the end of their leash!<br /><br />

<p class="block">At the End of Your Leash&trade; made me realize that there is so much more to owning a pet. It takes much more work than just putting a collar on your dog, feeding it, and cleaning up after it. It takes discipline and exercise, and all of that takes time. We put all of that into our kids, with love of course, why not our pets?<br /><br />Jenifer was recommended to us from our veterinarian, and I am so glad he did. She has taught me so much, and I would recommend Jenifer to everyone. She really opened my eyes! We are now working on a Conformation title in the show ring with our Old English Mastiff, "Gulphmills Max Power."<br /><br />The next time your dog takes you for a walk, give Jenifer a call; she can help! Thank You At the End of Your Leash&trade;!<br /><br />

<h3 class="large">Doug Behringer &amp; Macey <a href="javascript: testi_7toggle();" title="Read the Entire Testimonial" >( view the entire testimonial )</a></h3>
<div id="testi_7" class="moo_baby_moo">
<p class="block">"Skittish, scared, shy, anxious, destructive" these are only a few of the words that I would use to describe Macey, our 6-year-old German Shepherd/Chow mix, when I first adopted her. I had always made excuses for her, consoling her, and even trying to protect her from the world. This behavior only made matters worse which we soon found out about when we hired Jenifer. She taught me that I was in charge, and I didn't need to make excuses, I needed to be a good example for her. Macey had fed off all of my insecurities and worries. If I was scared and anxious, then she would be scared and anxious. I had to teach myself to be strong, take charge, and show her who was pack leader. <br /><br />
We were instructed to walk her daily, feed her as a reward for being a good example of how to follow the pack, and work on only giving her attention/affection when she is in a calm state of mind (no feeding into her anxiety) which was hard at first, but definitely makes a difference in the end. I can now describe Macey as being confident, obedient, responsive, loving, and calm. I thank Jenifer for helping me become who I needed to be in order to teach my dog.<br /><br />

<div id="testi_6" class="moo_baby_moo">
<p class="block">When I called Jenifer, I was truly "at the end of my leash". I had no experience in dealing with a severely abused and neglected animal. Like many humans, I thought love and affection would conquer even the worst of memories.<br /><br />
Jenifer showed me that part of the problem was with the dominance masquerading as cuteness from my little boy-pup, and that the best way to help my little rescue-girl move away from her past was to provide my entire pack with discipline and structure.<br /><br />
I'm very happy with the progress my pack has made with Jenifer's guidance. The playful, self-assured furrball wrestling with her little brother bears no resemblance to the terrified creature that entered my home 4 months ago.<br /><br />

Thanks Jen! You are awesome!!!<br /><br />
