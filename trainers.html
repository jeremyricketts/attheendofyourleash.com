<h3 class="large">Jenifer Freilich <span>Owner/Trainer</span></h3>

<p><a href="photos/bio_jena.jpg" rel="lightbox[jen]" title="Jen with Kingsden's Marzo, CGC (November 19, 1997 - February 19, 2005)"><img src="photos/bio_jena_thumb.jpg" height="116" width="130" alt=""  class="photo" align="left" style="margin-right:12px;"/></a>Jenifer's natural ability to understand, and connect with all animals has contributed to her success as a professional dog trainer. She has been using holistic methods to work with dogs, as well as other animals for more than 20 years. Her life path of working with animals began at the age of 5 when she was put on the back of a horse for the first time and progressed to Showing English/Western Equitation, and Pleasure, as well as Dressage, Show Jumping, and Cross Country Jumping.</p>

<p>Jenifer is a Mentor Trainer for the Animal Behavior College, a Professional Member of the Association of Pet Dog Trainers, Animal Behavior Management Alliance, Animal Behavior Society, Golden State Rottweiler Club, and a certified CGC (Canine Good Citizen) evaluator for the American Kennel Club, in addition to judging Showmanship classes for Southern California 4-H Clubs.</p>

<p>She has received formal training with internationally known trainers and authors George &amp; Karen Duet at one of Southern California’s largest dog training facilities. Her experience and knowledge covers many areas such as On and Off-Leash Obedience, Advanced Obedience, Agility, Show Conformation, Home &amp; Family Protection, Business Security, Detection Work, as well as Therapy and Service Dog Training. Jenifer has also had the opportunity to attend many seminars, and learn from some of the world's leading trainers and behaviorists such as Cesar Millan and Sue Sternberg. In April 2005, Jenifer also had the privilege of meeting and beginning studies in Dog Behavior and Psychology with Linn Boyke, one of only three people personally trained by National Geographic's "The Dog Whisperer," Cesar Millan. Her studies with Linn have not only changed the way she works with and understands dog psychology, but also her understanding of human psychology and it’s relation to our canine companions.</p>

<p>Believing in treating the dog as a whole, her years of experience also include canine nutrition, health &amp; wellness, as well as understanding the nature, psychology, and behavior of the domestic canine's wolf origin. Jenifer uses the knowledge that has been passed on to her by Tonya Littlewolf of the Wolf Mountain Sanctuary, as well as her own experiences with the wolves. These teachings, her studies with Linn Boyke, and her holistic approach to dog training make it possible for Jenifer to connect with all the dogs she works with bringing about profound improvement in their behavior, and their connection to the humans that love them.</p>

<p>Jenifer's work with all breeds and ages in behavior modification and solutions, problem solving, complete home manners, and multi-canine management has brought remarkable changes to all of her clients throughout Southern California. Her focus is not only on the well-mannered family companion, but also on the many healing benefits of dogs and other animals used in therapy, promoting responsible pet ownership, and helping families to choose the right companion animal for their home, and lifestyle. She believes that by helping her clients achieve complete fulfillment within their dogs, they will also find fulfillment. Jenifer draws from a lifetime of experiences with animal companions, as well as her years of yoga practice to help bring a calm, balanced energy to all her clients, canine and human alike!</p>

<h3 class="large">Rebecca Lestina <span> Trainer</span></h3>

<p><a href="photos/rebecca1.jpg" rel="lightbox[rebecca]" title="Road trip! Rebecca with &quot;Ren&quot; in Santa Barbara, Ca."><img src="photos/rebecca1_thumb.jpg" height="192" width="130" alt=""  class="photo" align="left" style="margin-right:12px;"/></a>It was obvious at a very young age that Rebecca's life would revolve around animals. She was put on a horse's back and riding competently before she could walk, and was familiar with her way around a show ring by the time she was 5. At age 10, her parents encouraged her to do something 'active' with the family's dogs' little did they know how seriously Rebecca would take that task, and how good a team they would make. They started at 4-H dog training classes, and quickly took the 4-H world by storm. By the third show, it was easy to see Rebecca was at the top of her game with no signs of slowing down. As Rebecca began to surpass her competition in that venue, she moved on to lead the training classes in hopes that her friends would catch up and give her some real competition. At age 11, she started helping friends with disabilities to teach their personal dogs how to assist them in everyday life. Picking things up, walking confidently off-leash in strange situations, and helping to stabilize an older, or paralyzed person while getting up off the floor were just a few of the behaviors taught to these dogs of all breeds and sizes. At age 14, a well-known International Judge and Labrador Retriever breeder asked her to start assisting in the training and handling of her dogs for her. Most weekends and some weekdays were then spent at the AKC shows, or training several dogs for the shows. After just turning 18, Rebecca turned to training dogs for a professional kennel. There the focus was obedience and protection, but remembering where she came from, she continued to give back to her community with her involvement in training the 4-H children. Through all of this Rebecca amassed uncountable Best In Show, Best of Breed, Master Handler, Best Junior Handler, High in trial, and High Score of Show as well as many other top show titles herself, with many more coming as the trainer of other dogs.</p>

<p>In 2000, Rebecca also began working at a veterinary clinic to hone her medical skills for the dogs. In 2004, Rebecca graduated from California Polytechnic University Pomona, with a Bachelors of Science in Animal Science focusing on Animal Behavior and Nutrition. Now while training dogs, Rebecca also works at a veterinary specialty office, which gives her access to some of the top veterinarians in the country.</p>

<p>Rebecca prides herself in training the family pet as well as the top show dog. Her main focus is training for the Conformation and Junior Handling ring, as well as Obedience, Agility, and Service Dog Training. She enjoys working with both children and adults, as the entire family should enjoy training and spending time with their companion.</p>

<p>In early 2005 I had the honor of meeting, and beginning studies in dog psychology and behavior with Linn Boyke. Linn's teachings have not only changed the way I work with animals, but also the way I experience the human-animal connection. Linn's guidance has had a profound effect on me as a trainer, and communicator with animals, as well as humans.
